    - typo in the pod
    - bug in the module
    - I'm not going to include the Makefile.PL anymore, it
      causes problems.

1.1: Mon Jul 28 06:42:14 EDT 2008
    - error in the Build.PL, must set default for prompt() so the
      smokers don't get an error.

    - built a tcp test [05], more trouble than you'd think... requires
      root, my default gateway is on eth2, etc...
    - added an icmp test [07]
    - added a tcp+icmp test [10]
      - same test one def filter [11]
      - same test one ipv4 filter [11]
    - added a tcp+icmp using two pcaps test [15]
      - same, but interleaved
      - same, but serialized
    - documented this mess

    - I found this stuff pretty hard to do the first time,
      knowing I'd want to do it all again without having to
      re-learn it all, I wrote this.
