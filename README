Net::Pcap does the job, but it's confusing and difficult to operate.  This
module solves that problem in a relatively general way.

I wanted an way to build libpcap filters really quickly.  It shouldn't take two
hours to crank one out, particularly since I imagine they all kinda look the
same.  So, I wrote this to simplify writing sniffers really quickly.
